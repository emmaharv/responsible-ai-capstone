# AI Regulations

## Class Coverage
* What does the impossibility theorem mean for organizations employing AI? 
* Should we just avoid using AI completely?
* What regulatory efforts help ascertain the definitions of fairness applicable to the use case?

## Pre-Class Readings

## Participation Questions 
_Submit to Gradescope by 10AM PT on Thursday, October 27th_
